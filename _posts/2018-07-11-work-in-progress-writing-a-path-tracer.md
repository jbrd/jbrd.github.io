title: 'Work In Progress: Writing a Path Tracer'
---

Throughout my career, I have used a handful of production renderers / path-tracers (PRman, Mantra, Clarisse, etc).

Having never had the chance to write a ray-tracer from scratch, I have started reading and working my way through the first volume of Peter Shirley's ['Ray-Tracing in One Weekend'](http://in1weekend.blogspot.com/2016/01/ray-tracing-in-one-weekend.html) book series.

Here are a few screenshots, I'll post more as and when I make progress:
